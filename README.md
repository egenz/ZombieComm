ZombieComm
====================

An Internet broadcast radio station called ZombieComm.

ZombieComm will work in a client-server model. The server will constantly be broadcasting out information about where to go for shelter and current coordinates of the zombie horde. Any number of human survivors should be able to connect as clients and all hear the updates at the same time. 

This is a group project.
